											Cyclist inattention is a leading cause of bicycle accidents, often resulting

											Failure to yield the right of way is a common cause of bicycle accidents,
											often occurring at intersections or crosswalks where cyclists interact. This
											can stem from a lack of awareness of other cyclists' presence or a disregard
											for traffic laws. Improving education and awareness among cyclists regarding
											each other's rights and the importance of yielding appropriately can help

											Unsafe passing distances by cyclists are a significant concern for cyclist
											safety, particularly on roads without dedicated bicycle lanes. Cyclists
											overtaking others without leaving sufficient space can lead to sideswipe
											collisions or force cyclists to veer off the road to avoid being struck.
											Factors such as high cycling speeds, narrow roadways, or blind curves can
											exacerbate the risk of unsafe passing maneuvers. Implementing guidelines or
											regulations specifying minimum passing distances and increasing education
											efforts can help protect cyclists from this hazard.

											Poor road conditions present significant safety challenges for cyclists,
											affecting their ability to navigate roads safely. Uneven surfaces, potholes,
											or debris can cause cyclists to lose control or sustain injuries if they
											collide with obstacles. Moreover, inadequate lighting or poorly marked
											roadways can reduce cyclists' visibility, increasing the risk of accidents,
											particularly at night. Municipalities should prioritize regular road
											maintenance and improvements to guarantee safer conditions for cyclists and
											pedestrians.
