												timeframes, including maintenance, spare parts, replacements, or

											Manufacturing defects happen when a product is improperly made, causing it

											engineering. Other common examples can include:
											<ul className="custom-bullets mt-3 mb-3">
												<li>
													<b>Automobiles</b>: Brake systems that are prone to failure due to

													Product liability refers to the legal responsibility of
													manufacturers, distributors, and sellers for injuries or damages
													caused by defective products they placed on the market. When a
													product is defective or unreasonably dangerous due to design flaws,
													manufacturing errors, or inadequate warnings, those responsible can
													be held liable for any resulting harm.

													Product defects can manifest in various ways, including design
													defects, manufacturing defects, and marketing defects. Design
													defects occur when a product's inherent design makes it unreasonably
													dangerous, regardless of how carefully it was manufactured.
													Manufacturing defects happen during the production process, causing
													individual units to deviate from the intended design. Marketing
													defects involve inadequate warnings, instructions, or labeling that
													fail to alert consumers to potential dangers associated with product
													use.

													product's defectiveness, medical records detailing your injuries,
